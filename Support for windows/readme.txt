modify the python file any way you wish.
just keep in mind that the dll file reads everything present in the transfer.json file and sends it
to the IP address 192.168.1.145 on port 5000. to change your server's ip address to a static one 
follow these steps.. https://websiteforstudents.com/switch-static-ip-address-ubuntu-17-04-17-10/
so store whatever you need sent into the json file but dont forget to clear it out first.
